          <!-- Also: https://japaneseruleof7.com/why-you-must-learn-kanji/ -->

          <h5>So, you decided to learn kanji.</h5>

          <p>Well, before you join the ranks of people who have devoted their lives to studying this mysterious form of communication, it would be useful to take a step back and review the whole process. We can say that there are 3 stages of learning kanji.</p>

          <h5>Step 1: Learn individual hieroglyphs</h5>

          <p>Well, there are only <a target="_blank" class="link link--light" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji">2136 joyo hieroglyphs</a>, how difficult can it be? Good. Over the years, people have offered many different ways to study them. Study only the values and forget the readings (Hazig method). Study them in the context of words, write them down, don't write them down, create mnemonics, turn them into funny pictures, disassemble them into their component parts. Somehow you will need to find a way to put them in your brain.</p>
          <h5>Stage 2: Learn complex hieroglyphs and words</h5>

          <p>Individual hieroglyphs are limited in their usefulness. Only when you start creating words and sentences with their help, they begin to acquire true meaning. Around the same time, the Japanese writing system starts to seem either endlessly fascinating or just plain stupid, depending on how you look at it. For example, 気 means “heaven" and 気 means “spirit". But when you put them together, they mean “weather". It's probably going to be hard for you to guess that heaven + spirit = weather, but at least you'll be able to make some sense out of it once you find out, even if it's a stretch.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, many things in Japanese are not even so clear. Let's see how you do with another example: 気, which means “spirit” + 象, which means “elephant” or “phenomenon". So what does 気象 mean? Hint: This does not mean the spirit of a dead elephant. And that's the problem.</p>

          <p>Even if you know all 2136 characters perfectly, you still won't be able to read Japanese. Because reading Japanese requires not only knowledge of all the individual hieroglyphs, but also a clear understanding of how they are used in combination to form words, and the number of these words is in the tens of thousands. In other words, this is a more serious problem than it seems at first glance.</p>

          <h5>Stage 3: Reading in Context</h5>

          <p>Now let me challenge you one more time. (Oh, and by the way, 気象 also means "weather”. Don't ask why.) The last task is to read the hieroglyphs in context. In real life, kanji are rarely found separately and in a beautiful frame. They come in a stream of text on a website, in manga or in subtitles that overload your working memory. This happens when you are standing on a moving train, simultaneously listening to an announcement, talking to your Japanese colleague and looking at something on your phone. At such moments, it is often impossible to remember even hieroglyphs that you know perfectly, simply because of information and sensory overload.</p>

          <p>It's not just a question of knowledge, but the skill of their application, so stock up on enough material that you like to study, no matter what it is, lyrics, anime, manga or articles on the Internet. Anything is suitable, as long as there is motivation to disassemble this content!</p>

          <h5>So let me leave you with two things.</h5>

          <p>The first is the idea that you don't need to learn all the kanji joyo at once. The Japanese don't do that. They study about a thousand in elementary school, but they study them through all 3 stages. With about 1,200 of the most commonly used hieroglyphs, you can easily (yes, not easily, but acceptable) form more than 10,000 of the most important words of the language and start using them meaningfully.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Secondly, learning to read in Japanese is actually a larger project than it might seem at first glance. You may be able to learn the cursory meanings of all the joyo hieroglyphs in a few months, but learning to read is a separate problem. It's nice to know what you're getting into.</p>

          <h3 id="Project" class="section__title"><a href="#Project">Project</a></h3>
          <p>Moonspeak is a workplace with a set of many tools that are very convenient for learning kanji.</p>
          <p>Open access will begin on July 20. In the plans:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Browser extension showing personal mnemonics for kanji</li>
              <li>Automatic creation of cards with hieroglyphs/words based on anime subtitles</li>
              <li>Online keyboard for typing in japanese</li>
          </ul>
          <hr />

        <section class="js-section">
          <h3 id="Development" class="section__title"><a href="#Development">Development</a></h3>

          <p>Moonspeak uses a micro service architecture, each backend component comes with its own frontend, which integrate via iframe element in the browser.</p>
          <p>In order to run locally, use the docker-compose.yaml file, which describes all the services.</p>

          <div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
            <pre class="code code--block">
              <code>
                $ git clone https://github.com/temach/jplang/ && cd jplang && docker-compose up 
              </code>
            </pre>
          </div>

          <p>You also need to a record to /etc/hosts to direct moonspeak.test to 0.0.0.0 ip address.</p>

          <div class="code__block code__block--notabs">
            <pre class="code code--block">
              <code>
                $ cat /etc/hosts
                # Static table lookup for hostnames.
                # See hosts(5) for details.
                127.0.0.1	localhost

                # moonspeak test environment 
                127.0.0.1	moonspeak.test
              </code>
            </pre>

            <p>Finally use the browser to request <a href="http://moonspeak.test" target="_blank" class="link link--light"><code>http://moonspeak.test</code></a></p>
          </div>
