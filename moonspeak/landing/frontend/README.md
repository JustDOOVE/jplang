# Moonspeak notes

Added gulp task runner to help with translations and bundling.

Unfortunatelly, have to ignore the npm audit warnings, see: https://overreacted.io/npm-audit-broken-by-design/



# Scribbler - a responsive HTML template for coding projects and documentations

![Scribbler Screenshot](./screenshot.jpg)

Scribbler is a responsive HTML/CSS/Javascript template designed for developers who want to set up a small landing page and a documentation/usage page for their coding projects. It is developed with vanilla javascript and many great CSS3 features, such as CSS variables and CSS grid. With performance and simplicity in mind, the template is built without any extra overhead of libraries and is easy to customize.
